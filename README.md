# Anime-Generation-using-Auto-Encoders
This technical investigation delves into the fascinating realm of transforming static images into captivating anime-style visuals. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of autoencoders, a type of artificial neural network, the study bridges the gap between the stillness of photographs and the expressive vibrancy of anime art. The primary objective is to strike a delicate balance between retaining the essence of the original image while evoking typical anime elements like flowing hair, dramatic lighting, and expressive eyes through subtle manipulations within the autoencoder's latent space. The investigation explores the nuanced relationship between stylization and accuracy, aiming to find the elusive "sweet spot" where slight modifications give the image a distinctive anime quality while maintaining its original composition.

## Abstract
The investigation pays homage to the innovative work of forerunners in the fields of neural network-driven image alteration and style transfer. Building upon their groundwork, we explore the finer points of anime picture conversion, with particular attention to the nuanced relationship between stylization and accuracy. Our goal is to strike a balance between retaining the essential elements of the original image and evoking typical anime elements like flowing hair, dramatic lighting, and expressive eyes through subtle manipulations inside the autoencoder’s latent space.
